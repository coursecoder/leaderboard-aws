## Introduction
The purpose of this work is to develop and deploy a leaderboard for your game using the following AWS resources: S3, APIGateway, Lambda, IAM, and DynamoDB. The choice of a highly available, scalable, and secure serverless environment with massive economies of scale will have several benefits to the end user, including:
- low product pricing
- fast response time, and
- reliable uptime
